<I><b>On May 1st, 2024, I made a decision:</b>
No more waiting. No more second-guessing. </I>
  
From that day on, I committed to showing upâ€” **every single dayâ€”to build the future I want.**


It wasnâ€™t just about learning. It was about proving to myself that I can create, grow, and rebuild from the ground up with stronger foundations.


I committed to a daily deep dive into the <b>core foundations</b> â€”probability, statistics, linear algebraâ€”paired with hands-on exploration in machine learning and deep learning. For 100 straight days, I studied, coded, wrote, and reflected. By October 2024, I had crossed the <b>100-day mark.</b>

But that was just the beginning.

In <b>2025</b>, Iâ€™ve taken it furtherâ€”diving headfirst into **MLOps**: the critical systems work that makes machine learning real. From <b>data pipelines and model orchestration to CI/CD, real-time serving, observability, and scaling</b>, Iâ€™ve been building systems that donâ€™t just work in theoryâ€”they work in practice.

By mid-2025, I reached **200 days** of focused, high-impact learning. And I havenâ€™t stopped. The journey continuesâ€”each post, each hour, each breakthrough shaping the skills, mindset, and systems that define my path as a machine learning engineer.

This project isnâ€™t a side quest. Itâ€™s the path.
Every post. Every hour. Every breakthrough.
Iâ€™m building the skills, mindset, and systems that will define my future as a machine learning engineer.

<i>**Iâ€™m not just studying. Iâ€™m training.**</i>
And the momentum keeps building!

### Data Science Project

#### [LLMOps - LLM-Powered Real-Time Translation System]

<I>In todayâ€™s world, seamless global communication is vital. I set out to design and implement a real-time translation system that combines advanced AI with scalable cloud infrastructure to process, translate, and monitor multilingual news streams with ultra-low latency.</I>

To ensure <b>transparency, reproducibility, and continuous improvement,</b> I rigorously documented the full development lifecycleâ€”versioning every pipeline iteration, capturing key design decisions, and logging detailed notes on challenges, optimizations, and breakthroughs.

This project delivered a <b>real-time multilingual translation pipeline built on LLMOps principles.</b> The architecture integrated:
- **Amazon EC2** 7 web multiple servers for scalability
- **Kafka** for distributed data streaming
- **Hugging Face** models for high-quality translations
- **FastAPI** for API management
- **Docker** for ensuring consistent deployment
- **Prometheus**/**Grafana** for real-time monitoring

The system tackled critical challenges around <b>latency, scalability, and evolving language trends</b>, resulting in a seamless and lightning-fast streaming experience.
