### My Github Blog

<I>**On May 1st, 2024, I made a decision:**
To stop waiting. To stop second-guessing.
And to start showing upâ€”every single dayâ€”to build the future I want.

I committed to a daily deep dive into core foundationsâ€”**probability, statistics, linear algebraâ€”paired with hands-on exploration in machine learning and deep learning.** I studied, coded, wrote, and reflected for 100 straight days by October 2024.

But that was just the beginning.

In 2025, Iâ€™ve taken it furtherâ€”diving headfirst into **MLOps**: the critical systems work that makes machine learning real. From **data pipelines and model orchestration to CI/CD, real-time serving, observability, and scale**, Iâ€™m learning to build systems that donâ€™t just work in theoryâ€”they work in production.

By mid-2025, Iâ€™ll have crossed <U>**200 days of focused, high-impact learning.**</U>
And Iâ€™m still accelerating.

This project isnâ€™t a side quest. Itâ€™s the path.
Every post. Every hour. Every breakthrough.
Iâ€™m building the skills, mindset, and systems that will define my future as a machine learning engineer.

Iâ€™m not just studying.
Iâ€™m training.
Letâ€™s keep going. ðŸš€</I>

### Data Science Project

#### [LLMOps - LLM-Powered Real-Time Translation System]

<I>In a world where seamless global communication is essential, I was challenged to develop a real-time translation system that integrates advanced AI and scalable cloud infrastructure to efficiently process, translate, and monitor multilingual news streams with ultra-low latency. </I>

To ensure <b>transparency, reproducibility, and continuous improvement,</B> I meticulously documented <B>the entire development process, versioning all pipeline iterations, tracking key design decisions, and logging detailed development notes, </B> including challenges, optimizations, and breakthroughs.
