### My Github Blog

<I>Starting May 1st, 2024, Iâ€™ve made a commitment to invest my time and energy in learning by writing a post daily about my discoveries. Each day, I dedicate several hoursâ€”<b>often 3 to 5 hours per day</b>â€”to revisiting foundational concepts in mathematics like **probabilities**, **linear algebra**, and **statistics**. I also explore exciting technologies such as **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, pouring into this journey with passion and determination. By October 2024, I will have reached <b>100</b> days of this enriching practice, and with each passing day, Iâ€™m not just gaining knowledge; Iâ€™m forging my path toward a future filled with endless possibilities! Letâ€™s keep moving forward together!</I>

### Data Science Project

#### [LLMOps - LLM-Powered Real-Time Translation System]

<I>In a world where seamless global communication is essential, I was challenged to develop a real-time translation system that integrates advanced AI and scalable cloud infrastructure to efficiently process, translate, and monitor multilingual news streams with ultra-low latency. </I>

To ensure <b>transparency, reproducibility, and continuous improvement,</B> I meticulously documented <B>the entire development process, versioning all pipeline iterations, tracking key design decisions, and logging detailed development notes, </B> including challenges, optimizations, and breakthroughs.
