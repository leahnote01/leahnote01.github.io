### üöÄ My Turning Point

**May 1st, 2024.**  
I decided to face my weaknesses ‚Äî not to avoid them, but to rebuild from the ground up.  
Two years into studying data science, I realized that while I could *use* algorithms, I didn‚Äôt *understand* them deeply enough.  
So instead of feeling overwhelmed, I committed to start over with intention and consistency.

I made a promise to myself: **one post, every single day.**  
My first goal was simple ‚Äî to dissect every algorithm, every concept, and rebuild my intuition.  
For a year, I revisited everything I had learned in graduate school and beyond ‚Äî  
**Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, and Database Systems**,  
then expanded into **Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and MLOps.**

During that summer, I spent 100 days immersed in study and reflection.  
By the start of the next semester, something had changed ‚Äî  
I no longer struggled with the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of technology or coding.  
I began to lead team projects as the **technical lead**, translating ideas into working systems.

That consistency became my foundation.  
By the end of 2024, I had explored **neural networks, transformers, data-centric AI, and conformal prediction**,  
and by 2025, I moved deeper into **MLOps** ‚Äî learning how **pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring, and drift detection** make models truly production-ready.

What began as rebuilding turned into transformation ‚Äî  
a journey of learning, building, and scaling as a MLops Engineer.

### Data Science Project

#### [LLMOps - LLM-Powered Real-Time Translation System]

<I>In today‚Äôs world, seamless global communication is vital. I set out to design and implement a real-time translation system that combines advanced AI with scalable cloud infrastructure to process, translate, and monitor multilingual news streams with ultra-low latency.</I>

To ensure <b>transparency, reproducibility, and continuous improvement,</b> I rigorously documented the full development lifecycle‚Äîversioning every pipeline iteration, capturing key design decisions, and logging detailed notes on challenges, optimizations, and breakthroughs.

This project delivered a <b>real-time multilingual translation pipeline built on LLMOps principles.</b> The architecture integrated:
- **Amazon EC2** 7 web multiple servers for scalability
- **Kafka** for distributed data streaming
- **Hugging Face** models for high-quality translations
- **FastAPI** for API management
- **Docker** for ensuring consistent deployment
- **Prometheus**/**Grafana** for real-time monitoring

The system tackled critical challenges around <b>latency, scalability, and evolving language trends</b>, resulting in a seamless and lightning-fast streaming experience.
