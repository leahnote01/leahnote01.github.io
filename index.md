### My Github Blog
**May 1st, 2024** â€” I made a promise to rebuild from the ground up.  
After two years studying data science, I realized I could *use* algorithms but didnâ€™t *understand* them deeply enough.  
So I started over â€” posting every day to rebuild my intuition and technical depth.

Over a year, I revisited **Statistics, Probability, Machine Learning, and Databases**,  
then expanded into **Deep Learning, LLMs, and MLOps.**  
That journey transformed me â€” from learning algorithms to leading **real-world ML & MLOps projects.**  

Through this commitment, Iâ€™ve written **over 200 in-depth posts** exploring everything from the foundations of statistics to the architecture of transformers and production-grade ML systems.  

Each post became a reflection of growth â€” documenting not only *what I learned* but *how I built, deployed, and optimized* real systems.  
Today, the blog stands as a living record of my continuous evolution from student to **Machine Learning & MLOps Engineer** â€” grounded in curiosity, consistency, and craftsmanship.

### Data Science Project

#### [LLMOps â€” LLM-Powered Real-Time Translation System]  
**| Kafka | FastAPI | Docker | AWS EC2 | Prometheus | Grafana | Hugging Face | LLMOps | MLOps | Machine Translation |**

Designed and implemented a **real-time multilingual translation system** that combines **advanced AI** with **scalable cloud infrastructure** to process and translate continuous news streams with **ultra-low latency**.

### ðŸ§© Architecture & Key Components  
- **Amazon EC2 (7 instances):** Multi-server setup for distributed scalability  
- **Kafka:** High-throughput message streaming backbone  
- **FastAPI:** Asynchronous API for low-latency translation requests  
- **Hugging Face (Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en):** Spanish â†’ English translation model  
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent, portable deployments  
- **Prometheus + Grafana:** Real-time monitoring and system observability

### ðŸš€ Impact  
- Achieved **sub-second translation latency** under real-time workloads  
- Built a **fault-tolerant multilingual pipeline** ready for production deployment  
- Delivered a **fully observable system** tracking latency, throughput, and translation quality in real time
