### My Github Blog

<I>Starting May 1st, 2024, Iâ€™ve committed to writing a post daily about what I learned that day. I revisited foundational concepts in mathematicsâ€”probabilities, linear algebra, and statisticsâ€”and explored technologies including Machine Learning and Deep Learning. As of October 2024, Iâ€™ve reached 100 days of this practice, and Iâ€™m continuing to move forward!</I>
