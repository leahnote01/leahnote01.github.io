### 🚀 My Turning Point

**May 1st, 2024.**  
I decided to face my weaknesses — not to avoid them, but to rebuild from the ground up.  
Two years into studying data science, I realized that while I could use algorithms, I didn’t understand them deeply enough.  
So instead of feeling overwhelmed, I committed to start over with intention and consistency.

I made a promise to myself: **one post, every single day.**  
My first goal was simple — to dissect every algorithm, every concept, and rebuild my intuition.  
For a year, I revisited everything I had learned in graduate school and beyond —  
**Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, and Database Systems,**  
then expanded into **Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and MLOps.**

During that summer, I spent **100 days immersed** in study and reflection.  
By the start of the next semester, something had changed —  
I no longer struggled with the *“how”* of technology or coding.  
I began to lead team projects as the **technical lead**, translating ideas into working systems.

That consistency became my foundation.  
By the end of 2024, I had explored **neural networks, transformers, data-centric AI, and conformal prediction,**  
and by 2025, I moved deeper into **MLOps — learning how pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring, and drift detection** make models truly production-ready.

What began as rebuilding turned into transformation —  
a journey of learning, building, and scaling as a **Machine Learning & MLOps Engineer.**

### Data Science Project

#### [LLMOps - LLM-Powered Real-Time Translation System]

#### 🌍 Overview  
In today’s world, seamless global communication is vital.  
I designed and implemented a **real-time multilingual translation system** that combines **advanced AI** with **scalable cloud infrastructure** to process and translate continuous news streams with **ultra-low latency**.

#### 🧩 Architecture & Key Components  
- **Amazon EC2 (7 instances):** Multi-server setup for distributed scalability  
- **Kafka:** High-throughput message streaming backbone  
- **FastAPI:** Lightweight, asynchronous API for real-time translation requests  
- **Hugging Face (Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en):** High-quality Spanish→English translation model  
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent and portable deployment across environments  
- **Prometheus + Grafana:** Real-time monitoring and visualization for system observability  

#### ⚙️ Implementation Focus  
Applied **LLMOps principles** to ensure **transparency, reproducibility, and continuous improvement** —  
versioning every pipeline iteration, documenting key design decisions, and logging detailed notes on challenges, optimizations, and breakthroughs.

#### 🚀 Impact  
- Achieved **sub-second translation latency** under streaming workloads  
- Built a **scalable, fault-tolerant multilingual pipeline** ready for real-world deployment  
- Delivered a **fully observable system** tracking latency, throughput, and translation quality
